<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am ambitious and driven. I thrive on challenges and constantly set goals for myself, so I have something to strive toward. 
  I'm not comfortable with settling, and I'm always looking for an opportunity to do better and achieve greatness.
  I am highly organized. I always take notes and use a series of tools to help myself stay on top of deadlines. 
  I like to keep a clean workspace and create a logical filing method so I can always find what I need. 
  I find this increases efficiency and helps the rest of the team stay on track, too
  </p>

<p>I'm a people person. I love meeting new people and learning about their lives and their backgrounds.
   I can almost always find common ground with strangers, and I like making people feel comfortable in my presence. 
   This skill is especially helpful when kicking off projects with new clients. 
   I am an excellent communicator. I pride myself on making sure people have the right information because it drives better results.
    Most business issues stem from poor communication, so I feel responsible for keeping everyone on the same page.</p>

<p>I am results-oriented, constantly checking in to determine how close or how far away we are and what it will take to make it happen. 
  I find this pressure inspiring and a great motivator for the rest of the team.</p>
